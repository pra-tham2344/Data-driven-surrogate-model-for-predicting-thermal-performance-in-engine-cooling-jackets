# Data-driven-surrogate-model-for-predicting-thermal-performance-in-engine-cooling-jackets
## Objective

My goal is to simulate flow and thermal performance in a cooling channel wedge using OpenFOAM, extract velocity and pressure data, generate visualizations, and prepare structured CSV data to later train a machine learning surrogate model for rapid predictions.
